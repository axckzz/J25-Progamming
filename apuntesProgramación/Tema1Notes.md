# :rocket: **Tema 1 in programming!**

:pencil:  **Interesting vocabulary about programming!**
 ---
- **Abstraction** = Don’t mind into the details, just generalize. Is the opposite of figuration.
- **Function** = Bunch of code that does something when it’s called. Parameter, variable that is sent to the fuction, to see it’s behaviour.
- **Compiling** = Take and translate the whole source code into machine code.
- **Interperer** = Have the source code and transform line by line to machine code.
- **Boilerplate** = In computer programming, boilerplate code, or simply boilerplate, are sections of code that are repeated in multiple places with little to no variation.
- **Arrays**: Arrays are containers that hold variables; they're used to group together similar variables. You can think of arrays like shelves at a pet store. The array would be the shelf, and the animals in cages are the variables inside.
- **Bit**: The individual 1's and 0's you see in binary are called bits.

- Markdown
- Every website have html.
- Brackets []
- Parenthesis ()
- Curly Braces {}
- Micro Controller: are a type of computers.
- LED - Light Emiting Diode 
- IDE – Integrated Development Enviroment. 
- Variable is a glace in memory where the can store data and it’s identified so we can repesite in.
- Variables can have types to specify how much memory do they need and the possibilities they can offer.
- In c++ and other highly typed programming lenguages, types are mandatory to be specified.

**Types of PL**

- Highly typed PL 
*C++* 
- Loosely typed PL
*Python*

**Common primitive variables in C++**

- Building blocks 
- Object 
- Complex type of variable 
- Numbers &rarr; int, long, 8int, 8u int, float.
- Strings = Strings 
- Char = Character
- Booleans = true/false

**Syntax of variables in c++**

- Declaration: 
```c++
int dotDuration; dotDuration = 500
```

- Type of variable:
      name/identifier 
- Constants:
SCREAMING_Snake_case
Kebab-case

**Functions in programming**

X &rarr; f &rarr; f(X)
- Functions are subsets of code defined to be executed when they are called they can have parameters that change the behaviour of the function (or not).
- They can return (or not).
---
**Function syntax in c++**
- Definition
&larr; return time (void i none)
```c++
Void nameOfTheFunction() {code}
```
No spaces allowed / parameters if we have

==We cannot define a function inside the definition of another function.== :warning:

---
**Calling a function:**
```c++
nameOfTheFuction();
```
Has to be the exact same name parameter if are defined.

---
**Example of calling functions:**
```c++
digitalWrite (int pin, 1 or 0) 
delay (            )
pinMode (              ,mode);
```
---
**Examples of defining functions:**
```c++
void setup() {
void loop() {
```
