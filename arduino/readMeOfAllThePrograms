BlinkVariations Explanation: This Arduino code initializes the onboard LED pin, turns the LED on for 2 seconds, turns it off for 1 second in the setup function,
and then creates a continuous loop in the loop function, where the LED flashes for 0.5 seconds and turns off. turns off for 0.5 seconds.

Special_Character_Of_Alvaro Explanation: This Arduino code initializes the onboard LED pin, turns the LED on for 2 seconds, turns it off for 1 second in the setup function, and then creates a continuous loop in the loop function, where the LED flashes for 0.5 seconds and turns off. Turns off for 0.5 seconds.
void setup() Function:

Initializes serial communication with a baud rate of 9600, allowing communication between the Arduino and the connected computer through the serial monitor.

void loop() Function:

Contains the main code that runs repeatedly in a loop.
Prints a special message and ASCII art to the serial monitor.
The ASCII art represents a simple image.
Adds new lines for spacing.
Delays for 1500 milliseconds (1.5 seconds) before repeating the loop.

MORSECODE Explanation: The Morse code representation is done through the duration of LED on/off states, where dots are short pauses and dashes are longer pauses.
The sequence loops continuously in the loop function, repeatedly spelling "ALVARO" in Morse code with appropriate pauses between letters.

FunctionalProgramming1 Explanation: The program uses the morseDot and morseDash functions to modularize the code and simplify the representation of dots and dashes.
The sequence loops continuously in the loop function, repeatedly spelling "ALVARO" in Morse code with appropriate pauses between letters.

FunctionalProgramming2 Explanation: This program organizes the Morse code representation into separate functions for each letter, enhancing code readability 
and maintainability. The loop continuously spells "ALVARO" in Morse code using the built-in LED, with appropriate pauses between letters.

FunctionalProgramming3: This program enhances code reusability by introducing a function (morseBlink) to handle the blinking logic. 
Each letter function then calls this common function with the appropriate number of dots, creating a modular and organized Morse code representation.

FunctionalProgramming4 Explanation: This Arduino program utilizes the Serial communication interface and the built-in LED to repeatedly print the message "I like Brasil" 
to the serial monitor every second.

FunctionalProgramming5 Explanation: This Arduino program prints the Morse code representation of the sequence "ALVARO" to the serial monitor in a loop. 
Each letter is represented by a combination of dots and dashes, and the forward slash ("/") is used to separate letters.
