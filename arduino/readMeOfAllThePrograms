BlinkVariations Explanation: This Arduino code initializes the onboard LED pin, turns the LED on for 2 seconds, turns it off for 1 second in the setup function,
and then creates a continuous loop in the loop function, where the LED flashes for 0.5 seconds and turns off. turns off for 0.5 seconds.

Special_Character_Of_Alvaro Explanation: This Arduino code initializes the onboard LED pin, turns the LED on for 2 seconds, turns it off for 1 second in the setup function, and then creates a continuous loop in the loop function, where the LED flashes for 0.5 seconds and turns off. Turns off for 0.5 seconds.
void setup() Function:

Initializes serial communication with a baud rate of 9600, allowing communication between the Arduino and the connected computer through the serial monitor.

void loop() Function:

Contains the main code that runs repeatedly in a loop.
Prints a special message and ASCII art to the serial monitor.
The ASCII art represents a simple image.
Adds new lines for spacing.
Delays for 1500 milliseconds (1.5 seconds) before repeating the loop.
